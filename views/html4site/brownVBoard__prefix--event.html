<p><span class="callout">On May 17, 1954</span> the U.S. Supreme Court handed down one of its most important and influential rulings — in Brown v. Board of Education, the Court stated that the racial segregation of public schools was inherently unequal. This unanimous 9-0 decision is credited with launching the modern civil rights movement, and eventually would result in fundamental changes in the way Americans thought about, and dealt with, not just education but deeply entrenched beliefs about race.</p>
<p>These beliefs were also felt on the nation’s playgrounds, football fields, basketball courts and other athletic venues. Eventually, the spirit of change also reached these culturally important places. West Virginia University and the College of Physical Activity and Sport Sciences are proud to host this three-day celebration of pioneering athletes — brave men and women who weren’t afraid to go first.</p>
